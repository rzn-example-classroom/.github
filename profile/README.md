# GitHub Classroom Example
## by [@RyzenFromFire](https://github.com/RyzenFromFire)

This organization serves to host an example instance of GitHub Classroom (of which, what parts are possible to publish have been published) alongside a [tutorial on how to construct said classroom](https://github.com/rzn-example-classroom/tutorial). The tutorial contains information for both educators and students. I hope you find it useful in your pursuit of knowledge using GHC.
