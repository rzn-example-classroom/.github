# GitHub Classroom Example
## by [@RyzenFromFire](https://github.com/RyzenFromFire)

This organization serves to host an example instance of GitHub Classroom (of which, what parts are possible to publish have been published) alongside a [tutorial on how to construct said classroom](https://github.com/rzn-example-classroom/tutorial). A comprehensive guide to Git, GitHub, and GitHub Classroom for students is [available here](https://github.com/rzn-example-classroom/git-and-github-intro). I hope you find these resources useful in your pursuit of knowledge using GitHub Classroom.
